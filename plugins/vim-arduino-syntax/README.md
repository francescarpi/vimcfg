The syntax file was originally created by Johannes Hoff. I regenerated the file using his [python script](https://bitbucket.org/johannes/arduino-vim-syntax) and added some additional changes on top of it.

TODO

- Create a separate branch for Arduino 1.5
- Automatically include keywords from keywords.txt of Arduino libraries
